# homepage

## What is it?
Homepage is a project, created to train HTML, CSS and JavaScript basics, containing some personal information about me.

## How to use it?
Just open the page and you can see two features inside - you will find two buttons under my photo:
1. 'Hide/Show photo' button will make my picture disappear. By clicking it once again, you can make this picture show on the website again.
2. 'Dark/Light mode' will change the colors on the website to dark, so it's easier to read after sunset, and also looks cool!
